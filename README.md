## Project Three (CS 360)

PLANR is an event tracking application developed to meet the needs of users seeking efficient event tracking and scheduling assistance. Its primary goals were to simplify organization, ensure users never miss important events, and provide a seamless user experience.

To support these objectives, various screens and features were necessary, including a home screen, displaying upcoming events and quick access to scheduling tools, an event management screen, allowing users to create, edit, and delete events with ease, and a notification settings screen, enabling users to customize their notification preferences. The UI designs prioritized simplicity, clarity, and intuitive navigation. Color schemes and iconography were carefully chosen to enhance usability, and layout designs focused on minimizing cognitive load for users. The success of the designs stemmed from their alignment with user preferences and behaviors, resulting in a user-friendly interface that facilitated efficient task completion.

In coding the app, I utilized object-oriented programming principles and followed a modular approach to ensure maintainability and scalability. Techniques such as code refactoring, code review, and continuous integration were employed to enhance code quality and streamline development processes. These strategies could be applied in the future to optimize code efficiency and facilitate collaboration among team members should the application undergo further development.

Continuous debugging was crucial for identifying and rectifying errors or inconsistencies, ultimately guaranteeing a reliable user experience. Testing revealed areas for improvement, such as optimizing performance and refining user interactions, which were addressed iteratively throughout the development cycle. Innovations were required throughout the app design and development process, particularly in integrating advanced notification features and permissions requests. Overcoming challenges related to optimizing app performance through eliminating redundancy and following a consistent structure across several Java and XML files.

One specific component where I demonstrated knowledge and expertise was in designing the permission request screen. This involved using a semi-transparent background to provide an overlay for push notifications, and multiple buttons with different results. By ensuring a seamless and transparent permission request process, I showcased proficiency in backend integration, UI design, and user experience optimization.
